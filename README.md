# *ft_printf*

<p>The ft_printf function is a simplified version of the standard printf function found in the C Standard Library. </p>

<p>The goal of this project is to implement a custom version of printf, which solidified my understanding of several core programming concepts, such as string manipulation, memory management, and variadic functions.</p>
